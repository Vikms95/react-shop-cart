## Description
Videogame digital key webpage where you can filter videogames with the various options provided. You can later modify the amount of items of each unit and check-out to proceed with the payment. 

## Getting started

```
git clone https://github.com/Vikms95/react-shop-cart.git
cd react-shop-cart
npm install
npm start
```

## Project Objectives

1. Do my first project which incorporates React, Typescript, TDD and react-router
2. Establish an ESLint config for future use
3. Be able to spend my time to make this project portfolio worthy
4. Use different git tools to solidify what I've learnt on previous lessons
5. Establish a good testing architecture combining unit and UI tests

## What I've learnt with this project

1. Using react-router
2. Passing setState as props to change state from parent component
3. Check library documentation to look up the code logic and get to use its functions in a better manner
4. Typing props and function parameters with Typescript

## Technologies used

1. React
2. Jest / Testing-Library
3. react-router
4. Typescript
5. ESLint

## Challenges I faced 

1. Make app aware of what is being rendered and what is not
2. Figuring out what to test on my components
3. Setting up Typescript strict mode

## Room for improvement

- After further reading, saw that passing setState directly as props
  is not good practice. Refactor to encapsulate setState within a function and then pass that function as props

- Set loading animation upon loading (after further reading, I should try doing it with a HOC https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/06/higher-order-components-react/)

- Set "No results found" message when no results from the API are given

- Fix ImageSlider animation to be smoother

- Fix video scaling or use another one with better aspect ratio

- Add infinite scroll by making a bigger request while scrolling down the page

- Apply light forms background like in : https://filext.com/file-extension/RULES
